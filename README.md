### Project Description: Investigating the intersection of coffee quality, consumption, and health.
A global health research firm has hired your group as consultants to explore the intersection of coffee consumption, coffee quality, and population health outcomes. They are interested in understanding how national coffee habits relate to health metrics, disease prevalence, and self-reported well-being indicators, with the goal of providing actionable insights for both public health policy and the specialty coffee industry. Through out midterm project, we will explore some driving questions:

1) Is there a measurable relationship between average coffee consumption and rates of heart disease, diabetes, or obesity across countries?
2) Do populations with higher coffee consumption show better or worse self-reported health indicators (e.g., energy, sleep quality, mental health sentiment online)?
3) How does caffeine intake relate to average life expectancy or reported well-being metrics?

### Data Sources
- International coffee production and consumption statistics
- Coffee quality evaluation datasets
- Individual-level coffee consumption and health surveys
- Public health and epidemiological datasets (heart disease/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, life expectancy)

### Purpose
We chose to investigate the intersection of coffee quality, consumption, and health because it connects everyday behavior with global health outcomes in a way that is both data-rich and socially meaningful. Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, yet its effects on health—both positive and negative—remain debated. By combining datasets on national coffee consumption, disease prevalence, and self-reported well-being, we can explore how lifestyle habits reflect and possibly influence population health. This topic allows us to integrate diverse types of data (economic, nutritional, and epidemiological) and apply analytical methods that link consumer behavior with public health indicators. It also provides an opportunity to critically assess how perceptions of caffeine and “healthy energy” evolve across cultures, blending quantitative analysis with human-centered insight.
